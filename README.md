### Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to illustrate key indicators about the academic performance of PyCity schools for use by leaders in the district. Once equipped with the information provided herein, administrators will be able to observe potential correlations between funding, school size, school type and academic performance. These observations will help to inform upcoming decisions about budget and school management policy.

To note, the results shared below will compare the findings from (1) an initial analysis and (2) an adjusted analysis. The adjusted analysis omits a set of inaccurate academic data that had artificially inflated the academic results for Thomas High School (THS). The comparisons demonstrate the effect of omitting the inaccurate student performance data.

### Results
The sub-sections below outline how each facet listed has been impacted by the omission of Thomas High School's 9th grade test results.

#### District summary
Because THS' 9th grade academic scores tended to be higher than the school and district averages, replacing them means that the second analysis' outputs for academic results are lower. The images below demonstrate several modest differences in academic performance between the two analyses.

We expected these differences in results to be marginal given that THS 9th grade students comprise such a small percentage of the overall district population. When comparing the first and second school-specific analyses, we found that the changes therein were similarly modest.

#### School summary

##### Comparing aggregate results by school for each analysis
As predicted, omitting scores from THS had no effect on the results for the other 14 schools. For THS, changes in academic results between the first and second analysis ranged between a few hundredths and a few tenths of a percentage point -

**Revised School Summary

Results decreased modestly in terms of Average Math,  % Passing Math, % Passing Reading, and % Overall Passing. The largest drop was in % Passing Reading, where omitting THS' 9th graders led to a drop of 0.29 percentage points in the proficiency rate. The result for Average Reading increased slightly (by 0.05 percentage points).

##### Comparing math and reading scores by grade
Predictably, other than the effect on THS' scores of omitting its 9th grade results, there was no change in math and reading scores by grade between the two analyses.
