### Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to illustrate key indicators about the academic performance of PyCity Schools for use by leaders of finance and policy in the district. The descriptive statistics captured in the tables that follow depict both aggregate, district-level indicators and disaggregated data for each of the 14 schools. Variables describe a set of budgetary, demographic, and performance-related metrics of interest to district administrators. Once equipped with the information provided herein, administrators will be able to observe potential correlations between funding, school size, school type and academic performance. These observations will help to inform upcoming decisions about budget and school management policy.

To note, the results shared below compare the findings from (1) an initial analysis and (2) a revised analysis. The revised analysis omits a set of inaccurate academic data that had (for the most part) artificially inflated the academic results for Thomas High School's (THS) 9th graders. The comparisons demonstrate the effect of omitting the inaccurate student performance data on district and school level data.

### Results
The sub-sections below outline how each facet listed has been impacted by the omission of Thomas High School's 9th grade test results.

#### District summary
Because THS' 9th grade academic scores tended to be higher than the school and district averages, replacing them predicted that, for the most part, the second analysis' outputs for academic results would be lower. The images below demonstrate several modest differences in academic performance between the two analyses.

We expected these differences in results to be marginal given that THS 9th grade students comprise such a small percentage of the overall district population. When comparing the first and second school-specific analyses (below), we found that the changes therein were similarly modest.

#### School summary

##### Comparing aggregate results by school for each analysis
As predicted, omitting scores from THS had no effect on the per-school results for the other 14 schools. For THS, changes in academic results between the first and second analysis ranged between a few hundredths and a few tenths of a percentage point -

##### *Figure 4: Revised School Summary - Revised Analysis*

Results decreased modestly in terms of Average Math,  % Passing Math, % Passing Reading, and % Overall Passing. The largest drop was in % Passing Reading, where omitting THS' 9th graders led to a drop of 0.29 percentage points in the proficiency rate. The result for Average Reading increased slightly (by 0.05 percentage points).

##### Math and reading scores by grade
Predictably, other than the effect on THS' scores of omitting its 9th grade results, there was no change in math and reading scores by grade between the two analyses.

### Summary

In sum, the omission of THS' 9th grade academic results had a small effect on the overall findings of this analysis. This was to be expected; THS 9th graders comprise just over 1% of the overall PyCity student population. The academic results for these ~400 students would have had to have been dramatically different from the district averages for their omission to have had a significant impact on the system's results as a whole. Even omitting them from the THS results - which meant reducing the school's n size considerably (over 1/4 of THS students are 9th graders) - turned out to have a muted impact. A quick set of calculations completed in Excel showed that THS' 9th grade results were comparable to the school's 10th-12th grade academic averages.

All of that said, there were differences between the initial and revised analysis. As described above, 4 of the 5 academic metrics lowered by either a few hundredths or tenths of a percentage point after omitting THS' 9th graders. The fifth metric increased slightly.
